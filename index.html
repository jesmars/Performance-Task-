      <p style="font-size: 1.3em; padding-top: 1em; text-align: justify;">Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances into the
        environment air,
        water, land, or sound causing negative effects on living organisms and natural systems.
        These pollutants can come from human activities like factories, vehicles, improper waste
        disposal, farms, and even construction.</p>

        System?</h1>

      <div class="interconnected-content">

        <p>Pollution affects global systems by weakening economies, harming societies, and pressuring political
          structures.
          <b>Economically</b>, pollution lowers productivity as people become sick,
          increases healthcare costs, and damages industries such as agriculture, fisheries, and tourism.
          <b>Socially</b>,
          polluted air and water lead to widespread health problems, reduce quality of life, and hit poorer communities
          the hardest,
          creating deeper inequality. <b>Politically</b>, pollution forces governments to create stricter environmental
          laws, manage conflicts over shared resources,
          and participate in international agreements on climate action. These effects are interconnected, meaning
          damage in one system—economic, social,
          or political—creates a chain reaction that influences the others, worsening the overall global impact.

    <h1 style="font-size: 2.3em; position: static; text-align: center; padding-top: 1.2em;">Filipino Context</h1>

    <div>
      <p>The Philippines is highly vulnerable to pollution because of its geography having many
        coastal and river communities and its socio-economic conditions, including poverty, informal settlements,
        and dense urban populations. Pollution worsens public health problems, and since many Filipinos rely on
        natural resources like fisheries and agriculture, environmental damage deepens inequality and
        threatens livelihoods. The cost of inaction is high: untreated pollution not only increases healthcare
        burdens but also weakens ecosystems that support long term economic stability and resilience, especially in
        a country already prone to natural disasters.</p>

    <h1>What we can do?</h1>

    <div class="fifth-hero-descrip">
      <p>Pollution is not just an environmental issue it is an ethical responsibility that every global citizen must
        address.
        Our actions directly influence the health of other people, the stability of ecosystems, and the future of
        communities
        that are most vulnerable to environmental damage. As individuals, we can take meaningful steps by reducing
        waste, choosing
        reusable products, conserving water and electricity, and supporting businesses that practice sustainable
        production. We can
        also advocate for stronger environmental policies, participate in community clean ups, and educate others about
        the consequences
        of pollution. When people act together across countries, cultures, and communities we create a collective force
        capable of protecting
        the planet and ensuring a safer, healthier world for future generations.</p>
